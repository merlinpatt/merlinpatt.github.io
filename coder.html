  <h1>Getting Good at Building Software with the CODERS acronym</h1>
  <p>When I tell people I build software, the question I most often get is:</p>
  <p>How do you become good at that?</p>
  <p>This question has an endless amount of answers but over my years of coding, teaching code, and talking to other engineers, I have boiled it down to seven major skills in the easily memorable acronym of CODERS.</p>

  <h2>C - Comb the Internet.</h2>
  <p>The ability to find an answer on the Internet is a skill that most forget or even deny. To many, this is a sign of an amateur, but this is false. No matter what you know or how long you have been doing it, searching the web is still necessary to find some solutions. This is especially true of code. Use Google, StackOverflow, StackExchange, blogs, anything at all.</p>
  
  <h2>O - Outreach (Ask questions).</h2>
  <p>This is another skill oft attributed to newbies yet experienced folk do this all the time. Never spend days Combing the Internet or struggling on a problem alone. Ask a friend, a coworker, a meetup group, or the Internet at large. Sometimes it is easier for someone else to see the missing piece when you have stared at the problem for hours on end.</p>
  
  <h2>D - Debugging.</h2>
  <p>Debugging is the ability to spot and fix errors found in code. There exist experienced engineers who are still unable to do this, so mastering this ability can set you apart from the crowd. This requires the skills of C and O, as well as the ability to interpret error messages and other problems with your code.</p>
  
  <h2>E - Explore.</h2>
  <p>Go beyond creating your own projects. Read blogs and tutorials and follow them! Contribute to open source projects. Recreate the work of others just to see if you can. Challenge yourself with new projects that you do not feel ready for. Go back and repeat the basics. Never stop exploring.</p>
  
  <h2>R - Reduce, reuse, recycle.</h2>
  <p>This is also known as beg, borrow, and steal. The Internet is filled with code examples and projects. GitHub hosts 28 million public repositories, StackOverflow has over 25 million answers, and npm has nearly 800,000 packages. All of this is available for you to use in your own code, tweak, and learn from.</p>
  
  <h2>S - Style and Stay the distance.</h2>
  <p>I will admit, this last one is cheating since it covers both styling and staying the distance, but CODERSS is not as nice of an acronym.</p>
  <p>First, style. Computers do not care about how nice your code looks, so you could put all your code on a single line, but this is the equivalent of writing a dissertation without any punctuation. Write your code so it is readable to your future self, and to anyone else you work with.</p>
  <p>Second, staying the distance. When you start learning to code, things seem easy, but at some point things will become hard, likely for some time. Do not give up. Persist. If you continue through the difficulties, you will reach a point where you feel both competent and confident about your skills.</p>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>You may have noticed a recurring theme throughout all of these skills: continuous learning. Never stop educating yourself, improving your skills, and widening your knowledge base.</p>
  <p>So just remember,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>C - Comb the Internet</li>
    <li>O - Outreach (Ask Questions)</li>
    <li>D - Debugging</li>
    <li>E - Explore</li>
    <li>R - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</li>
    <li>S - Style (and spacing)</li>
  </ul>
