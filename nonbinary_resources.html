  About Me

<p>
  I identify as genderless, meaning I am not a man, nor a woman, nor any gender. I use they/them pronouns.

    Genderqueer / Non-binary 101
  </a>
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    It is a mystery why so many people are comfortable being categorized in just one of two ways. Just as nobody knows why there are so many cis people, nobody knows why there are so many binary identified folks.
  </p>
  <p>
    But there are many trans people who are neither male nor female. They cannot be categorized as "either/or." These people may use terms for themselves like genderqueer, androgynous, agender (or no gender or genderless), or neutrois. They often use gender-neutral pronouns such as "ze/hir/hirs" or "they/them/their/theirs." They can be both male and female, or none of the above, multi-gender, genderless, or something else completely.

  <p>
    What does it really mean to be a man or a woman? Gender identity goes beyond gender roles. It runs deeper than clothes, hair, makeup, colors; although these are means to express it, they do not make your gender. To me gender identity is a feeling: something internal, intangible, and very difficult to explain with words.

  And here is something to think about when using supposedly gender-neutral terms like guy, dude, etc
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    If a straight guy tells you that "guys" is a gender-neutral term, ask him how many guys he&#39;s dated.
