  Darkness: House

  Red. So much red. It had been three days since he had entered the red world and still no change. It had started to get annoying. Things were far better when he had to imagine everything.
</p>

<p>
  And worse, he was hearing things again. Except this time they were louder. And they would not stop.
</p>

“Yak ouo ye ra. Es ael pp ue kaw. Gni de elb er uo y.” Over and over again. As far as he could tell anyway.

<p>
  But he powered on. He did not have much choice, after all. Oddly enough he did not seem to need food or sustenance of any kind.
</p>

<p>
  After another five days of walking, red, and voices, he stopped. He had noticed something out of the corner of his eye. He turned on the spot but saw nothing.
</p>

<p>
  He turned again, much more slowly this time. And there it was. A slightly lighter shade of red. He headed its direction and whatever it was grew bigger.
</p>

<p>
  As he got closer, its shape became more distinguished. It was a house. Somewhat oddly shaped. It looked similar to a mushroom. But still a house with windows and doors in all the right places.
</p>

<p>
  He approached the front door and knocked loudly three times. There was no answer.
</p>

<p>
  He tried again. This time he rapped five times. Still nothing. He tried once more. Seven times in a row. Each time he knocked harder than the time before. By the seventh knock his knuckles were bleeding.
</p>

<p>
  And still no answer. He went to the window and broke it with his sword. After clearing the glass, he stepped through the window. And that… That was when everything changed.
