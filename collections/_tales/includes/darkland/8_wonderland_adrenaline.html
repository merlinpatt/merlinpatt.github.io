<h2>
  Wonderland: Adrenaline
</h2>

<p>
  Alice was worried. The pool of red was growing without any sign of stopping. The boy did not seem to notice. Nor did anyone else.
</p>

<p>
  She tried to tell the driver but he told her to sit back down. And when she told the other students, they either ignored her or said nothing was wrong.
</p>

<p>
  When the bus finally reached the school, Alice ran ahead to tell the bus driver what had happened but he didn’t notice anything either and promptly got off the bus, mumbling under his breath, “Kids are getting crazier and crazier.”
</p>

<p>
  Alice had no time to wonder why no one else seemed to notice what had happened as the strange boy was losing a large amount of blood. She ran to the back of the bus to find that the blood had stopped and the boy was still there.
</p>

<p>
  Using only what she had in her bag, which consisted of her fuzzy sweater and her textbooks, she patched up his wound as best she could. With the sweater wrapped around his leg, it looked to be covered in fur as if he was some sort of animal.
</p>

<p>
  She spent another hour with him trying to get him to wake up but nothing worked. So she decided to use the only other item with her that day. Adrenaline.
</p>

<p>
  She took out the shot and prepared it quickly. She was well versed in using adrenaline as she was allergic to practically everything and so she had self administered it many times.
</p>

<p>
  After injecting the boy with it, she watched carefully for a reaction. She knew that it should only take seconds. Yet still this boy did not move. He did not even twitch.
