  Wonderland
</h2>

<p>
  With a spring in her step, Alice White bounded down the stairs to the breakfast table. Her mother, Carroll, called for her in the sing song way she always did. “Oh, Alice! Breakfast time.”
</p>

<p>
  As she reached the last step, her brother, Mathers, almost ran into her on his way back from the table, having eaten his breakfast at top speed as usual. In an undertone, he said, “Watch it, Wonderland.”
</p>

<p>
  She desperately wished to tell her mother about his annoying nickname. But she knew that would only create more trouble. And Alice hated trouble.
</p>

<p>
  The first bit of trouble she had ever been in was when she was five or six. She couldn’t recall exactly. She had snuck a rabbit into her room because she wanted to save it from the cold. Her mother’s reaction to this was not one she wanted to ever experience again.
</p>

<p>
  Alice finished her cake for breakfast in record time as she was nearly late for the bus to school. She bounded out the door, said goodbye to her mother with a kiss on the cheek, and skipped to the bus stop.
</p>

<p>
  The bus arrived, prompt as it always was, at half past eight, and she got on. She walked to her usual lonely spot in the back and sat down.
</p>

<p>
  As she sat down, she noticed that there was a boy sitting there. He did not speak and neither did she. But something about him and the fact that he was sitting in her usual spot told her that something was about to change.
</p>

<p>
  She wondered what it could be given that the rules of this virtual world were so strict in what could and could not happen.
</p>

<p>
  As she stared out the window at this virtual world that she and everyone else lived in, she yearned to see the wonderland that was the real world.
