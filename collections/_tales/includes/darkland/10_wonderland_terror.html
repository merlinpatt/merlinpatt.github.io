<h2>
  Wonderland: Terror
</h2>

<p>
  The bus lurched forward causing both Alice and the mysterious boy to fall over into the pool of blood.
</p>

<p>
  Alice got up immediately. But try as she might, she could not bring the boy up more than a few inches before dropping him again.
</p>

<p>
  This boy clearly needed help. Yet there was nothing she could do on her own. And no one in the school believed her. So what was she to do whilst she was stuck on the bus?
</p>

<p>
  And then she had an idea. She might be young but she knew the principals of what she was about to do. So she asked herself, “Really, how hard can it be?”
</p>

<p>
  She walked towards the front of bus and sat down in the driver’s seat. The keys were still in the slot, so she turned them.
</p>

<p>
  The bus rumbled to life instantly. She pulled away from the school slowly. Slower than a snail. She knew though that she had to pick up the pace if she wished to save the strange new boy.
</p>

<p>
  And so with marked determination, she pushed more and more on the gas pedal until it was on the floor.
</p>

<p>
  Fortunately for her, the road to her house was entirely straight. Well, almost anyway.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, she had forgotten about one small turn. As she approached the forgotten corner, her face turned into an expression of terror.
</p>

<p>
  She tried to slow the bus down. But it was far too late. The bus went flying off the road and straight into the nearby barn.
</p>

<p>
  A barn, painted with nearly the color of blood. A difference slight enough to only be noticed out of the corner of your eye.
</p>

<p>
  Getting up from the sudden impact, she turned around. And that… That was when everything changed.
</p>
