<h2>
  Darkness: Incorporeal
</h2>

<p>
  He stepped through the broken window, careful to avoid the shards of glass on the other side. He found himself in a long hallway.
</p>

<p>
  The walls of the hallway were painted strangely as if to resemble seats and windows, some of which were broken. However he could not quite place what they were seats and windows of.
</p>

<p>
  More surprisingly though, at the end of the hallway lay a figure that resembled a girl. As he walked down the hallway on the strange metallic floor, the girl shifted slightly before becoming immobile once more.
</p>

<p>
  Once he reached the girl, he spoke lightly to ask if she was okay. His voice continued to rise in worry when she did not respond. So he tried a different tactic.
</p>

<p>
  He attempted to nudge her awake. He was surprised to find that instead of nudging her shoulder, his hand went seemed to pass right through her. He tried again with the same result.
</p>

<p>
  It seemed that he was incorporeal. But what did this mean? Did this mean he was dead? He couldn’t be dead. He just couldn’t be.
</p>

<p>
  Or maybe it was the mysterious girl who was dead? But he had just seen her move a moment ago.
</p>

<p>
  He couldn’t worry about either possibility now. At the moment, he needed to help this girl if he could. But how could he do so when he couldn’t touch her?
</p>

<p>
  And then it came to him. He might not be able to interact with her, but he could certainly interact with the objects in this world. But as he looked around, he saw that the room they were in seemed to be bare of items.
</p>

<p>
  But then he looked up. And he saw a small box with a plus symbol. He knocked it down which caused the girl to wake up.
