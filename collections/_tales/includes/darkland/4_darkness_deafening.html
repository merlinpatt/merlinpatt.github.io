<h2>
  Darkness: Deafening
</h2>

<p>
  With every passing second, the growling grew louder. He knew it was useless to run when he could barely walk.
</p>

<p>
  So he picked up the sword and started swinging it like a madman. The growling became deafening and he kept swinging.
</p>

<p>
  Soon the sound encompassed his entire being. Every bone and muscle in his body began to shake with the soundâ€™s vibrations. He was no longer able to move of his own free will.
</p>

<p>
  The sword, too, had begun to vibrate. And then suddenly without warning, the sound stopped. The vibrations subsided. His hearing was surprisingly still functional.
</p>

<p>
  He examined the rest of his body as well as he could with his hands. Everything seemed to be fine as he progressed downward.
</p>

<p>
  First he tested the unbroken leg. And then he gingerly moved his hands onto his injured one. As his hands crept downward, he began to notice the difference.
</p>

<p>
  The furry object that he had used as a makeshift bandage had merged with his leg. His leg was now whole and pain free it seemed. Though he could not help but wonder what this new development would mean on his journey or what that sound had been.
</p>

<p>
  With no more pain in his leg, he began to test it. He walked and ran. He jumped and kicked. It was a considerable improvement. As he continued to test it, he began to realize that his leg was not only healed but vastly improved from what it had been. He could run at an incredible speed and jump extraordinarily high.
