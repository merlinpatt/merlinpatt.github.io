<h2>
  Darkness: Curiosities
</h2>

<p>
  As he reached the top of the basement, he remembered the first time he had gotten there.
</p>

<p>
  It had been a complete accident. He had fallen upon reaching the basement the seventh time. He could still feel the scars on his face and leg from the fall. And before he “woke up” he had been able to discover some curiosities about the basement.
</p>

<p>
  Each time down, he had explored each of those curiosities. The first was whatever had scarred him. Sharp on one side, long, and slightly curved, he assumed it was some kind of sword.
</p>

<p>
  As he reached the sixth step, he remembered the second object. It had been quite warm. And furry. At first he had thought it was some creature that would kill him, ending his torturous way of life. But he realized that whatever it was did not breathe, and so unfortunately could not harm him.
</p>

<p>
  As he reached, the eighteenth step, he recalled number three. It was some pit at the edge of the basement. He had discovered that it was deeper than his arms could reach. He had been debating for nights (or days, whatever they were) whether or not to jump in. To just end everything.
</p>

<p>
  But as he reached the final, the fortieth step, he wondered what would happen if he were to survive the jump. As he passed the sword, he carefully reached out (though he had memorized its location many nights ago) and picked it up.
</p>

<p>
  He passed the furry thing, still not knowing what it was, and picked that up too.
</p>

<p>
  He reached the edge of the pit. Though he could not see, he stared down it anyway. He took a deep breath. He closed his eyes. And he jumped.
