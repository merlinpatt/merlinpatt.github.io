<h2>
  Darkness: Red
</h2>

<p>
  With his new powerful, yet furry, leg and the fact that he no longer restarted his days whenever he slept, he began to explore the underground area confidently. Confidently as he could while still being blind, that is.
</p>

<p>
  In a short amount of time, he had managed to reach a wall. The wall was smooth with no defects that he could tell. And it merged with the ground seamlessly.
</p>

<p>
  He decided that the underground area was some artificial construction. He wondered about its makers and its purpose. Was it constructed specifically for him? Or were there others down in the pit as well?
</p>

<p>
  Lost in thought, he moved along the wall, keeping his hand on it the entire time. Suddenly the wall vanished from under his palm.
</p>

<p>
  And he could see. Well, not quite. He could see a world obfuscated in red. He blinked to make sure he wasnâ€™t imagining things.
</p>

<p>
  He stepped back a few feet to find himself shrouded in darkness again with the wall under his hand.
</p>

<p>
  Stepping forward again, he found himself in the world of red. Turning around, he saw a clear distinction between the red and the black.
</p>

<p>
  He took the time to look at himself. The sword he had brought along was in fact a sword, now dull at the end from using it as a cane. His body seemed to be without markings or bruises. His leg was covered in thick fur that seemed to move on its own.
</p>

<p>
  However strange his appearance had become, there was no going back now. And so he continued onward, into this new and unknown world.
