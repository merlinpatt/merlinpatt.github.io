<h2>
  Wonderland: Shriek
</h2>

<p>
  Alice woke up with a start. She was groggy and did not quite recall where she was. As she looked around, she remembered how the bus had crashed through the barn. She had flown forward at impact, which had knocked her unconscious.
</p>

<p>
  She surveyed the front of the bus to see what had woken her up. And she realized that the first aid kit had fallen to the floor. And then she noticed something even more startling.
</p>

<p>
  She screamed. A high pitched shriek that would have broken the windows of the bus had the crash not already done so.
</p>

<p>
  The boy. The mysterious boy was right in front of her. He was transparent. And floating. Clearly a ghost.
</p>

<p>
  She tried to get up and run. But she could not. She was pinned to the floor by one of the seats that had come loose on impact.
</p>

<p>
  Fortunately for Alice, the boy did not seem to want to harm her. In fact, he seemed to be trying to help her but could not. He even seemed to be saying something but he made no sound.
</p>

<p>
  Then suddenly the boy stopped and made a quick motion with his arm. The seat seemed to be lighter. When she looked at it, it was as if pieces of the seat had been cut away by some sword.
</p>

<p>
  She pushed the seat away from her. As she stood up, she realized that the boy had helped her. Though how he had done so without any help was a mystery to her.
</p>

<p>
  She knew she had to help this boy. Perhaps she could return him to his body. Or help him move on into the afterlife.
</p>

<p>
  So she held out her hand, merely as a gesture, and led him to his body at the back of the bus.
