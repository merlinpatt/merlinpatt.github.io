  Darkness
</h2>

<p>
  The darkness enveloped him. He could not escape. He could not breathe. He had only minutes left.
</p>

<p>
  He awoke, breathing heavy. “Third night in a row,” he thought to himself. “What is going on with me?” He climbed out of bed slowly, still a little fearful from his nightmare.
</p>

<p>
  As he flicked on the light, he thought, “I’m going to have to start leaving the lights on.” The room stayed black. He flicked it back and forth. Still no light.
</p>

<p>
  It seemed that his worst nightmare was coming true. He cautiously headed towards the door. “Perhaps it’s only my room.” Opening the door, he saw that the hallway was also dark.
</p>

<p>
  He continued even more cautiously to the stairs. Keeping his hand on the railing, he stepped methodically down the stairs.
</p>

<p>
  At the bottom of the stairs was a window. Once he reached the window, he opened the blinds. And things were still dark. “Have I gone blind?” He asked.
</p>

<p>
  He reasoned with himself that he could see his own hands, so he must not be blind. He ignored the lack of explanation for why he could see nothing else and continued on through the house.
</p>

<p>
  His goal: the basement. The basement held the breaker to turn the lights. “The lights went out. That’s all. I just need to turn them on again.”
</p>

<p>
  He reached the basement door and turned the knob. He stepped through the door frame and stopped. The air had gone from the room. Just like his dream. He tried to turn around but could not. He tried to move forward but was unable to.
</p>

<p>
  He awoke. “Fourth night in a row, now.” He proceeded to his light switch again. And again the lights failed to turn on. “Will this ever end?”
</p>
