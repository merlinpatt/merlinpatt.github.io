<h2>
  Darkness: Peace
</h2>

<p>
  The mysterious girl had gotten up once he had removed pieces of the object blocking her with his sword.
</p>

<p>
  At first she had screamed. It was a scream that he could not hear but he knew it was a scream nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
  But once she realized he did not mean to hurt her, she stopped. And now she was offering her hand to him.
</p>

<p>
  He could not take it, but he suspected she knew that and that it was a gesture of kindness.
</p>

<p>
  He placed his hand in hers and she led him to the window he had broken. As they got closer, things started to go in and out of focus.
</p>

<p>
  But even with his vision blurring, he could see that there was a body by the window. This body was a boy. Facedown on the ground, he could not see it who was. But he suspected.
</p>

<p>
  And he began to tremble in fear at his suspicion. But it could not be, he thought. It could not be.
</p>

<p>
  They reached the body, and his suspicion was confirmed. He knew the body was his.
</p>

<p>
  In retrospect, he realized that it only made sense. He had relived the same nightmare over and over again and had experienced impossible transformations.
</p>

<p>
  He wondered why though. What was the point of that torturous nightmare. Or his long journey through darkness and the world of red?
</p>

<p>
  As he wondered, the girl began to cry. And then he knew why. All of it was to help her. To save her. If he had not been there., he shuddered at the thought. He felt at peace and was willing to move on.
</p>

<p>
  And suddenly, his vision went black.
