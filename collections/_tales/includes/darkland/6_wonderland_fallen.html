  Wonderland: Fallen
</h2>

<p>
  As the bus slowed to a halt, the bustle of Alice and the other students grabbing their bags commenced.
</p>

<p>
  Except for one, she noticed. The strange boy that had sat in her spot. She said, “Come on. We have class.” He did not respond. She nudged him but again no response.
</p>

<p>
  Not wanting to be late herself, she left him sitting there in his stupor.
</p>

<p>
  As the day marched on, and as Alice went from class to class, she could not stop thinking about the strange boy.
</p>

<p>
  When the bell rang signaling the end of school, Alice ran to the bus and jumped on. She was disappointed to find that the boy was gone.
</p>

<p>
  Once home, she went through her daily routine of cleaning, dinner, homework, television, and reading. However, her usual routine did not have her typical cheery attitude.
</p>

<p>
  After sleeping and going through her morning routine again, Alice got onto the bus and found the boy in her spot again.
</p>

<p>
  She tried to get the boy to move again. And for the next week or so, she continued to follow this new routine.
</p>

<p>
  On the seventh day, she mustered up all her strength and shoved him. And then everything seemed to slow down. The boy was knocked off the seat towards the floor. Her peers and the driver turned their heads. She apologized profusely.
</p>

<p>
  And then time went back to normal. She realized that the boy had fallen but was still not moving. While she was puzzling over this new development, she noticed something else by his leg. Something red.
