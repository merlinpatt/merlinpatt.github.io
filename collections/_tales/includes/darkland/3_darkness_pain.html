<h2>
  Darkness: Pain
</h2>

<p>
  He awoke again. This time with a less sharp pain then the previous nine nights since his jump.
</p>

<p>
  After he had jumped, time had seemed to slow down. Or perhaps in this strange world, it actually had. He had felt the crack as it slowly worked its way up his left leg. He had felt the blood warm his leg. And then he had fallen asleep again.
</p>

<p>
  On the first day he awoke and immediately he realized that he was not in his bed. He was still in the same spot that he had fallen to. He might still be trapped in this darkness but he had made progress. Or he hoped so anyway.
</p>

<p>
  He tested his leg, as he had done every day, to see if he could move it without having his body explode with pain. It still hurt. But he could drag himself along using the sword as a makeshift cane. It was slow but it worked.
</p>

<p>
  With the furry object wrapped around his leg to soak up any blood, the sword at his side as a cane, and his slow, bedraggled walk, he imagined that he must be quite the sight. If only he could see himself.
</p>

<p>
  Every painstaking hour, or what he believed to be such, he stopped and examined the area immediately around him for any clues as to the right direction or where he was, and for any more curiosities that could help him.
</p>

<p>
  After five hours, he had discovered almost nothing. The ground was cold, hard dirt. There were no plants of any kind that he could feel. Frustrated, he swung the sword at the ground, narrowly missing his own toes.
</p>

<p>
  The sword clanged against the ground. He didnâ€™t even hear an echo in response. And then, off in the distance, he heard something. He waited, and this time, he heard it more clearly. It had gotten closer. It was a growl.
