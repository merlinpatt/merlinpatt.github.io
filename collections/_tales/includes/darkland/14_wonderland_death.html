  Wonderland: Death
</h2>

<p>
  After they reached his body, Alice knelt down and began to cry. She now knew what she had suspected all along.
</p>

<p>
  The boy was dead. And this figure with her was his ghost. She could do nothing for him, yet he had saved her. And so she wept.
</p>

<p>
  As she wept, the wind had begun to rise. It had started to howl. She looked up, worried that it might be the boy, vengeful for his death. But instead she was surprised to see that the boy’s ghost was fading. And suddenly, it was gone.
</p>

<p>
  She wept even harder at that. The boy had moved on. And then as she was crying, she felt a hand on hers. It was the boy’s. Somehow he was alive.
</p>

<p>
  “Thank you,” He said. “I’m Cheshire.”
</p>

<p>
  “Thank you.” She responded. “I’m Alice.”

  Elsewhere, a man in a lab coat turned to his partner. “They passed the second test, ma’am.”
</p>

<p>
  “Start the third one.” She commanded.

  Their vision went black.
